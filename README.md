# Disruptive Technologies 

## History of Video Streaming Services
## How They Gained Popularity

The history of streaming services arguably began with Netflix when they first introduced their streaming service for free because it was included in the company’s physical DVD subscription package back in 2007. 

 Nowadays, *Netflix* is a tour de force - the one-stop streaming service that has all the best of old TV series, films, along with chart-topping originals in its arsenal. Netflix with its home base in Los Gatos, California, now has 18 office locations across 14 countries including the Philippines. Each of these with its own original shows and movies exclusive to their location.
It’s a far cry from what it used to be in 1997: a rent-by-mail DVD service using a pay-per-rental model. In the past, users went to the Netflix website to put an order for films and Netflix would send it via post. Now, users can access Netflix on TV, laptop, phones, and other devices that connect to the internet and stream anything they want without additional cost. 

Netflix has proven the quality of their originals that they started winning prestigious awards usually given to series on cable TV (e.g. *House of Cards*) and shake up the Hollywood giants by winning Academy Awards for their films and documentaries (e.g. *Roma (2019)*, *American Factory (2020)*). 

Globalization along with the continually changing landscape of the Internet made digital streaming services the better alternative for cable or pay-TV. The following are a few more reasons why this disruptive technology rose to popularity:

### Innovative Technology

Netflix has been around since 1997 as a rent-by-mail DVD service. However, they only incorporated online streaming in 2007, when higher-bandwidth Internet became more common and affordable. This allowed Netflix to provide both DVD-by-mail and online streaming as options for their subscribers. The following year, Netflix would announce the halt of its DVD rental service as they debuted Watch Now on Mac platforms. They also announced a partnership with the American cable TV Starz, allowing Netflix access to over 2,500 titles at just $30 million (Fritz, Flint, 2011). At the time, there were few real competitions for Netflix because very little actually saw the potential for a streaming service to be profitable. Through its partnerships, Netflix was the first streaming service to actually be accessible on multiple devices such as Xbox 360, Smart TVs, PS3, and Apple devices, to name a few. 

Even with thousands of titles accessible on its website, it wasn’t until 2013 with its three high-budget original shows - *House of Cards, Hemlock Grove, and Orange is The New Black* - did Netflix actually successfully rebrand its image as a game-changer for the entertainment industry;  Netflix’s original shows received 31 Primetime Emmy nominations that year. To date, Netflix has garnered 203 awards and 432 nominations. 

### Convenience

When computers and an Internet connection have become more affordable,  it became a commodity for every household to have one. The same is true for cell phones which become ‘smarter’ and more sophisticated with every new release. With only so much time to unwind after a long day at school or at work, we would take any chance we can get to do so. With our gadgets, particularly our smartphones, it has become easier to catch up with our favorite series, anytime we want to. We miss a lot with cable TV, like a daytime soap opera, for example - unless it is recorded but with streaming services, we can catch up at our own pace. 

### It’s worth the cost

For an average working person, it becomes more practical to pay for comforts like a Netflix Subscription than Cable TV. a subscription for streaming services can be used anytime and anywhere in the world as long as there are internet and data connection. Cable TV would probably cost as much, depending on the subscription package, but it still cannot be taken anywhere besides where it is connected. There is also an added incentive that streaming services don’t have commercials and it makes for good, uninterrupted viewing. 

### Customized content

Netflix’s algorithm suggests new content unique to every user based on how they interact with the service. It takes into account the nuances of the content the user previously watched and how they rated other titles. Through this, the algorithm suggests new shows or films that audiences would normally overlook. This innovative technology means that Netflix anticipates what an audience needs before the audience even thinks about it. People’s regular pay-TV still requires manual browsing and the content is not curated to the customer’s palette. 

### Creative Freedom

Adding to Netflix’s popularity is the diversity of their talent pool and content. As a venture capitalist, Netflix invests its deep pockets and other resources in start-ups (i.e. new series or film). This allows Netflix to churn out new original and exclusive content at a faster pace than their competitors, along with the fact that the streaming service is available worldwide except in a few select countries. According to the streaming search engine *Reelgood* as reported by *Business Insider*, Netflix has the most original shows at 674 compared to its competitors: HBO Max (190). Amazon Prime Video (134), Hulu (87), Disney Plus (26), Apple TV Plus (23). The same report also states Netflix having the most “high-quality” TV shows, defined by *Reelgood* as having an 8.0 and above score on IMDb (Clark, 2020). 

This model gives Netflix an edge over its competitors, but it is also the reason why some new shows get canceled rather quickly before they even have the chance to actually take off. At the end of the day, Netflix is a business. However, it remains a better alternative for both seasoned pros (e.g. David Fincher, Martin Scorsese) and novices waiting for their big breaks. Netflix allows them creative freedom as opposed to more family-oriented brands like Disney. 

### Netflix is still the King of Streaming

Netflix had several major competitors during the early months of 2020. There were new launches from companies that have been around far longer than Netflix. Among them are Disney+ (2019), AppleTV+ (2019), and NBCUniversal’s Peacock (2020), all of which had access to thousands of titles that are no longer available on Netflix. In early March, Netflix was laying off employees as the company overhauled its marketing strategies. According to Netflix’s quarterly earnings report as published by *The Hollywood Reporter*, Netflix’s global subscriber base rose 20 percent to 167 million members. However, viewership in the U.S. and Canada has slowed even if these were the regions with higher market saturation compared to the rest of the world (Masters, Sandberg, 2020). 

In a report published by *Forbes* early in November, Disney+ dominated the ‘streaming wars’ as its subscribers rose to 73.7 million, surpassing the company’s expectation to achieve it in 2024 (Freeman, 2020). The price of a Disney+ subscription is offered at $6.99 (up to 4K resolution) a month in the U.S., still cheaper than Netflix’s Basic Plan of $8.99 (4K resolution is available with the Premium Package at $15.99/mo). Disney also has the advantage of time as an entertainment company so they do not have as much pressure as Netflix to churn out fresh new content. According to that same report, Netflix has Projected Original 2020 Content Spend of  $4.5 billion while Disney+ only has Projected Original 2020 Content Spend of $1.3 billion. The estimates of Netflix’s expenditure on new content is still larger than its other competitors: Amazon Prime ( $1.3 billion), Apple TV+ ($1.9 billion), Hulu ($170 million), Peacock ($1 billion), HBO Max ($1.2 billion) CBS All Access ($800 million). 

Nevertheless, Netflix’s early investments in research and development made it ubiquitous - compatible for almost every device and its service is available globally. Although Disney+ is Netflix’s main competitor, for now, Netflix remains the king of streaming services worldwide.

## Impact to the Disruptees

Back in 2017, there had been a significant focus on online streaming services that had caused a major disruption to the television and movie industry. Netflix, specifically, is the first major subscription-based movie and TV streaming service (using the internet) that serves as the on-demand platform that offers an inexpensive alternative to traditional expensive cable TV services anytime and anywhere. 

When it started back in August 1997, it did not provide what it is known for today. Launching only its mail-in subscription service, the disruptor only appealed to a few customer groups. According to Christensen (2015), the hallmark of disruption is when a company targets segments of the population that have been overlooked by its competitors, delivering an inferior (but more tailored) alternative, often at a lower price. Eventually, such companies move upmarket while keeping the advantages that it had in the beginning as well as adding the things that mainstream customers want. And without anyone realizing, there is no reason to have cable and DVDs anymore, at least because of this disruptive technology. 

Movie Rental Market (DVDs)

One of the most well known American-based providers of home movie and video game rental services is Blockbuster (also known as Blockbuster LLC or Blockbuster Video). Netflix, which started as a DVD by mail service competed with such traditional rentals that it even tried to pitch an idea to Blockbuster, offering to “build their streaming service in exchange for a cash infusion and 49% of the company.” Although this is the case, the founder, Reed Hastings, already had plans for it to become a streaming service long before the idea was economically or technically viable. Returning to the offer, it was refused by the giant rental company which then led them to file for bankruptcy in 2010. Up until today, you could barely hear someone using DVD players; instead the conversation starter that we would always encounter is “what is a good movie or series to watch on Netflix?” The huge shift came with the rising of streaming video. Services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Now, and the like were able to appeal to DVD rental’s core audience by providing a wider selection of content with an all-you-can-watch, on-demand at low-price while still experiencing high-quality with a highly convenient approach. 

Television and Movie Industry

With 4 in every 10 TV households now subscribing to streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu, it’s obvious the benefits it offers. Rather than requiring their subscribers to pay a large upfront fee, they keep things simple by offering a low monthly price that’s affordable no matter what one’s income might be. Although streaming services did not have a first window right into any of their programming, they still provide a more convenient alternative to traditional cable TV to many users at a much lower cost. 

When Netflix launched its streaming service in 2007, it acquired content produced by different studios, mostly for movies that had already been released in theatres and for TV shows that had either already finished or those that are still being aired but had a large window between their first time air date on network TV. This growth in streaming service is not only disrupting the TV industry, but is also impacting the number of people who choose to go to the traditional cinema. The number of pay TV subscribers has evolved over the past 10 years with the numbers steadily decreasing since 2012 as the number of streaming services subscribers grew in the same time period. Consequently, total admissions (as in number of tickets sold) in movie theatres have been steadily decreasing in the US since the boom of home content consumption alternatives.

The reason behind this shift from pay TV into streaming platforms, mainly Netflix, can be attributed to, as was mentioned before, simply a better user experience, at a better price. Netflix gives the users the ability to consume content at their own pace. When they want and how they want. They can watch through the entire thing at once or in more than one sit in. Additionally, users don’t have to sit through commercials which not only makes for a worse user experience, but also increases the overall amount of time that a user has to sit through to consume a movie or a TV episode. In relation to this, in the long run, video streaming service's success may lead to the unbundling of cable; cable customers may be allowed to pick and choose channels rather than pay for a whole batch to get what they want.

“The reason why disruptive companies are often able to rise so quickly is that their larger competitors overlook them” (Christensen, 2017). They are not initially competing for the same customers and so the big companies do not see them as a competition. And in the case of Blockbuster, it was not able to overlook their position in the long run that they even refused to acquire Netflix’s offer, making them now an example of a disruptee.

## Business Models for Video Streaming Services

The emerging Internet-based broadcasting system has increasingly challenged traditional platforms for TV and film distribution and production. Grappling with outdated business models mainly based on physical media and facilities, many industry players in broadcast and cable television, as well as in film and music, are embarking on innovative ways to create unique online content using new digital technologies, new distribution systems and largely new revenue mechanisms. 
Game changers headed by Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Studios and even Youtube (Google) are breaking new grounds as they create more original, prime content aimed for Internet distribution. Purportedly the most successful video-on-demand streaming service to date, Netflix has steadily produced all-original series (House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, BoJack Horseman, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, among others), gaining both commercial success and critical acclaim. 

A growing number of independent content producers and even media giants has progressively reduced dependence on conventional cable providers or broadcast networks for distribution. For consumers, the rise of this subscription-based business model for distributed content offers more freedom of choice, a la carte entertainment, and increased control of programming and scheduling of preferred shows. It dissolves the necessity to purchase bundles of channels in which many consumers simply end up paying for content that they often never watch. With the explosive growth of mobile devices and their ubiquitous usage as an alternative to traditional media screens, online streaming services significantly complement the evolving viewing habits of a new generation of captive consumers. 

Rather than establishing their own industry-wide online delivery system, many major TV networks and film outfits are now forging connections with tech-based Internet distributors like Netflix, Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple for media distribution. Netflix in particular has quickly distinguished itself as the non-cable alternative to cable TV. Even as original productions are expensive, Netflix is able to differentiate its own content which attracts new subscribers and also reduces the company's cost for licensing existing content from mainstream outfits. While movie theater chains and DVD rental/sales stores in the pre-Internet era were never involved in actual film production, distributors like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and Google have shown financial capabilities to make feature-length movies. 

### Revenue Models for Digital Content Delivery

Online TV and movies loom to be the largest and fastest growing form of online entertainment. In general, three revenue models for delivering content on the Internet are identified as follows: 

a. Subscription
Opting for quality and convenience, many consumers have increasingly opted to purchase premium content. This revenue model offers a type of "all you can eat" flexibility for consumption.

b. A La Carte
Essentially a "pick-and-pay" pricing model, customers pay for individual shows in a selection menu. This enables consumers to have a more customized experience based on content preferences and spending capacity.

c. Advertising-supported
This model depends on advertising revenue to provide free content. Alongside is  usually a "freemium" option for purchase. Contrary to some claims, free content can actually even lure customers to paid content, as evidenced by the success of the likes of Pandora and Spotify.

### Video-on-Demand fee-based business models

Video-on-Demand services allow customers to decide when and where they want to watch movies or TV series. The worldwide revenue of US$53.0 billion in 2019 is expected to grow to US$96.0 billion in 2025

Video-on-Demand (VoD) content distributed over the Internet includes three fee-based business models: 
a. Transactional VoD (TVoD) - This consists of rentals as a single transaction or pay-per-view. 

b. Subscription VoD (SVoD) - This represents rentals as subscription-based services.

c. Electronic-Sell-Through (EST) - This encompasses purchased downloads or cloud storage. 

Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are some popular examples of the subscription-VoD or SVoD model. For a monthly subscription fee, consumers can access movies and TV series which are streamed to a variety of supported devices. 

### Quick Figures:

* Global revenue in the video streaming (SVoD) market for 2020 is pegged at US$51,617m, with most of the revenue generated in the U.S.
* The average revenue per user (ARPU) in the video streaming (SVoD) market is estimated to be at US$58.52 in 2020.
* A significant increase in video streaming subscriptions was seen in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, Netflix had 201.18 million global subscribers which is projected to reach 275 million in five years. 
* User penetration is estimated to be 11.9% in 2020 and is expected to rise to 17.2% by 2025.
* The number of global users/subscribers is expected to amount to 1,337.1m by 2025.
* Subscription projections for the year 2025 see new players rising as well. Apple TV+ is expected to rack up over 27 million global subscribers, while HBO Max could amass over 27 million.
